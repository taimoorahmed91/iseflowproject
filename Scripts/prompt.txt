I have an ISE (Identity Services Engine) authorization policy configuration file in JSON format. I need you to analyze this file and create a hierarchical decision tree structure.
CONTEXT:

The file contains policy sets with authorization rules
Each authorization rule has a rank (sequence number) that determines evaluation order (lower rank = evaluated first)
Each rule has conditions (in ConditionAndBlock with children array) that check attributes like rVLAN, NetworkZone, Tenant, etc.
Each rule has a profile that is the result/outcome if conditions match

WHAT I NEED:
Create a decision tree that shows how ISE evaluates these policies in a hierarchical flow.
TREE STRUCTURE:

Top Level: All unique rVLAN values found across all rules
Second Level: Under each rVLAN, all unique NetworkZone values that appear with that rVLAN
Third Level: Under each NetworkZone, all unique Tenant values that appear with that NetworkZone
Leaf Nodes: The authorization profile (result) and the rule rank/name

REQUIREMENTS:

Process rules in order by their rank value (ascending)
Extract all conditions from each rule's condition.children array
Build the tree showing all possible paths through the conditions
At each leaf node, show: rule name, rank, and the resulting authorization profile
If a rule has missing attributes (e.g., only rVLAN and Tenant, no NetworkZone), handle it appropriately

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Please provide the decision tree in one of these formats:

Nested JSON structure
Mermaid flowchart syntax
Text-based tree diagram
Python dictionary structure

IMPORTANT:

The hierarchy order is: rVLAN → NetworkZone → Tenant → Result
Rules are evaluated top-to-bottom based on rank
Show which rule creates each path in the tree

the JSON file is processed_data.json
